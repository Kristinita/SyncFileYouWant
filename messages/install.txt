Sync File is now installed
=============================

To enable using Sync file, you need to first config your source and dest locations at:
Preferences > Package Settings > Sync File > Settings - User. 

I recommend you copy the settings file template from:
Preferences > Package Settings > Sync File > Settings - Default

And add your source and dest locations based on that template. 

Source and dest locations will automatically include all their sub-folders. 

To sync a file to dest location, simply click Ctrl + Alt + S at the file you want to sync.

Alternatively, you can click Tools >  Sync File > Sync File

To sync multiple files, at side bar, choose multiple files, right click > Sync File
